Employees standing around not assisting customers.  Some of the issue was related to no inventory at the the first store and having to go to a second store, then having to go thru the slowest queue ever! Twice! The oaklawn store is better. But the process is broken.",Negative,99.2502,1,Yelp
Dallas3,32.8293128,-96.8272358,5616 Lemmon Ave Dallas TX 75209,7/13/2015,This is the second time I come here and each time it was to exchange a cell phone case. They have about 7 people in store and I have to wait over 30 minutes to exchange a case- that is ridiculous. What happened to having a cashier for simple things like this? I am walking out and never returning to this store. I loved the case I wanted to exchange mine for but I don't have 30+ plus to sit and wait for it.,Negative,99.8540,1,Yelp

The other seven customers still in limbo had miraculously not been helped - but when you're playing with your hair and tossing rolls of tape around its difficult to manage actual work.

The manager was no help either. My phone was water damaged and I was looking to buy a new one and was fine paying full price and couldn't even do that! The manager was no help either.

Went to pick up the phone and Jose was extremely helpful. Had a little bit of confusion with the phone buy back credit amount, but Josh the manager took care of it and made it right. Have been to some pretty awful ATT stores but this is where my future business will go. Thanks guys!",Positive,68.7460,4,Yelp

That should let you know this location is amaxing at what they do.There's always somebody at the door and they always give out complimentary water. Everybody always looks nice and customer service is always on point. Thank you for always going above and beyond even when it comes down to the small thing's. That's what makes people like me keep my business with AT&T.,,5,Yelp

Dallas10,32.953929,-96.821254,5100 Beltline Road Ste. 1032 ,4/17/2016,"Service is very inconsistent and the sales people are dishonest.  If there were another pretty At&t store around the corner from me, I'd go there instead of here!  There's not so I've been 4-5 times in the last 30 days, enough to know they need to do better.  I can't say any of the times I visited, my needs were truly assessed.  They generally looked for the fastest way to send me home.  On my second visit, I was told to go home, turn my phone off then on again and he was sure it would be fine.  Obviously it wasn't!  I returned the same night, was greeted by seemingly helpful people who put my name in the system, and then I sat on the couch for more than 30 minutes.  I thought I was okay but when the ipad they have hooked up near the couch had such slow service I could no longer stand to watch my favorite show, I left.  Slow service on THEIR device in THEIR store is unacceptable.  During another visit, I was told my account had a $107 credit balance and I could just not pay the next month.  On my last visit, I was told that was very wrong and I owed $107 for the current month (my plan rate went up).  Thanks for nothing.During each visit, they tried to sell me a new shiny phone with a new 2-year contract, preferably an iphone.  The last visit turned out to be the most offensive.  I bought my LG phone and insurance from Walmart with no contract then went to At&t to turn the phone on.  They tried to sell me a G Pad as a special offer ""just for me"" (later told it's for anyone).  I was repeatedly told it cost 99 cents.  I asked if there would be more to pay and learned you pay like $10/month for 2 years.  Even after that, they kept telling me what a great deal it was for 99 cents and every time they said the words 99 cents, I echoed, ""and $240"".  The clerk brought in reinforcement to get all in my business and pretend she loved me then the reinforcement tried again to sell the 99 cents (and $240) gPad.  The next thing she tried was selling me insurance that cost around $11/mo for 2 years plus a $199 deductible.  I told her Walmart charged $59, covered more than what she told me they covered, and had a lower deductible.  She told me another big difference in the plans is Walmart wouldn't offer the service of locking and erasing my phone if it was stolen but if I bought an at&t plan, they would.  That almost got me but I wasn't really going to trust her.  Today, I'm digging through my phone and discover that lock and erase service is FREE from at&t and already on my phone!The last thing they tried was to take away my unlimited text and data usage saying I never used anywhere near 5 gigs.  When I was in a few weeks ago, the same guy who told me I had a $107 credit on my account showed me that I was using at least 4-5 gigs every month.When I went to the Yelp event, the store made me think I could put my mobile needs in their hands and be worry free.  What I learned when I actually needed them is that everyone (even non techies like me) is required to do their own research and fact checking before arriving or get hosed!",,2,Yelp
Dallas10,32.953929,-96.821254,5100 Beltline Road Ste. 1032 ,9/27/2016,Worst customer service ever! The agents act like I should be thankful for their help. I will say there were two individuals that were great. Cori has the idea that AT&T will not be able to function without her so she can talk to Anyone as she chooses. I'm strongly disappointed in my experience there and will be moving my services to another provider,,1,Yelp
Dallas10,32.953929,-96.821254,5100 Beltline Road Ste. 1032 ,1/27/2016,"Very dishonest.  Be careful.  These guys will outright lie to you.   After signing up for my phone plan, I was offered a deal to get a tablet for $1.  I said yes.  On the bill, it was $180.  I went back to the store and they would not remove the charge.  Also, I was offered a discount through my employer.  However, six months later, the discount has never been applied to my bill. Do not trust these people.",,1,Yelp
Dallas10,32.953929,-96.821254,5100 Beltline Road Ste. 1032 ,7/5/2016,"This store single handed, helped me finalize my decision to leave AT&T after 14 years. Everybody should know this is the same store/owner from down the street on belt line, anybody who remembers that location site knows what kind of service to expect at this location site. (blah blah blah) When you wrap up a piece of dog crap with nice paper and a pretty bow.. It is still a piece of dog crap. I'm not impressed with gross couches covered in human slime caused mostly by kids running around yelling spitting picking their nose, or the lack of stools, or the fact that most people inside this store are not even conducting business. The used car sales man techniques, of holding the door open trying to build a certain level of trust between strangers. ""Please give me a break"" They will just screw you over in the end so why pay more. They work off commission here, and you never see the same face.",,1,Yelp
Dallas10,32.953929,-96.821254,5100 Beltline Road Ste. 1032 ,9/20/2015,"This is an awesome store; I came by to comparison shop and it makes me wish I was an AT&T customer. Two people held doors open for me when I arrived while a third greeted me to offer his assistance. The place is beautifully laid out with lots of staff, very clean, all phones on display, a cool looking service center, and a DirecTV area with a couch and some TV watching. They even have tables in the middle where staff can sit with you and your family to help you set your phone up without standing awkwardly at the counter.I went from here to a Sprint store where half the phones they have for sale weren't even on display and their Galaxy S5 that was on display had a cracked screen.That all said, you are paying for this nice store experience in your plan fees. My Sprint plan is $25/month cheaper than a comparable AT&T plan, and it's not worth $300/year to me to have nicer stores to visit.The one thing about this store that I didn't love is that they don't have any kind of brochure or literature I could take with me. So I had to remember all the details the guy was telling me and there was no way to write anything down or have a reference guide unless I brought my own pen/paper, which I didn't. So I wish they had something they could hand out to customers.",,4,Yelp

Greeted warmly by two reps who opened the door for us and welcomed us into a beautiful, clean store. I had purchased a Neo Gear 2 watch phone for my son for his birthday but it wouldn't work with his Galaxy S4 running 4.22. Assisted by awesome service tech Brandon who upgraded phone from 4.22 to 5.0.1 and allowed him to download Gear Manager. Happy wife=happy lifeHappy son=#winningBig Thumbs Up!",,5,Yelp
Dallas10,32.953929,-96.821254,5100 Beltline Road Ste. 1032 ,9/26/2015,Super friendly! Super helpful! I ordered my iPhone 6s and they gave me a deal for an iPad mini for $100. Of course I took up on that offer! My mom has been wanting an iPad so I just have it to her. My mom is old fashion and still use a flip phone. Now she has texting/email capability and doesn't have to call me everyday lol. Scored!  they helped me set up my new phone when it came in and just explained everything to me. The whole process was less confusing than doing it online myself.,,4,Yelp

Until Ethan and Austin worked their magic and they were able to resolve my issue. I would highly recommend asking for Ethan if you plan on going to this AT&T. Also the store incredibly nice, much better than the new store on Oaklawn.",,5,Yelp

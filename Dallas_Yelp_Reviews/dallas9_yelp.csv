Waited more than 30 minutes with 5 employees on the floor who were not waiting on customers but visiting with each other.

Dallas9,33.009892,-96.709061,"701 N Central Expy Plano, TX 75075 ",1/6/2016,"Recently my wife and I stopped into our neighborhood AT&T store at 811 N Central ExpresswayPlano TX 75057. She had a gift card and wanted to use it to purchase the new iPhone and renew her contract. The first sign of trouble showed itself when the greeter opened the door for us. As she was not dressed for inclement weather and it was surprisingly cold outside, I commented, ""You kinda got the crummy job tonight!"" in a jovial tone, whereupon she looked at me with disdain and sneered, ""I'm just opening the door for you"".Okay... odd, but likely being in the cold wasn't leaving her in a great mood. I dismissed it and we moved to the cheerful router, who sent us to meet our specialist for the evening, Tennyson.Once we were seated I sat quietly while my wife began explaining what she was after, and while the agent's answers were curt, they weren't rude up until the point where my wife indicated 'she will be upgrading too'.This stopped the process dead in its tracks as Tennyson made it a point to stop what he was doing and look up, then around. ""She? Who you talkin about? Is there another woman here? You said she, it confused me.""There were three of us at the table. No mistaking his 'confusion'.I'm a transsexual. So is my wife. And snide little asides like this are not something that I pay for when seeking services. When the agent went out of his way to insure that he had made his feelings about me abundantly clear, I chuckled. It isn't the first time I have ever run into a bigot, nor do I suspect it will be my last. But it is the first time I have encountered one in an AT&T store. He went to the back, collecting a few more of the black polo-shirted agents as well, glancing over his shoulder at us and snickering.I convinced my wife that our money would be best spent elsewhere. She made an excuse about not having the pin for the card on her person when he finally returned and we left, though in truth I would have been far more content to just walk out. The longer I thought about his pointed insult the more irritated that I became.I work as a manager, and I have to answer to my customers for the actions of my employees. Transphobic behavior such as this is intolerable in the 21st century, yet there it was, and I suspect will remain. I expect a degree of professionalism out of AT&T, and their representatives. If I want to be insulted by a frat boy for not adhering to his personal standards of feminine beauty then I will go to a fraternity party, not an AT&T store. We did buy a new phone, from another location where we were treated with respect and dignity. And quite frankly, we won't be returning to the AT&T store at Colin Creek, because if that is who they employ then they clearly do not need our business. Nor anyone that of anyone else who will listen to us. I'll be reposting this to Yelp and Google as well, and I will cheerfully tell anyone else who will listen to avoid this location.We will remain with AT&T because we have contracts. But this location is dead to us- I thought you might want to know why.",,1,Yelp

                Updated review",Update: I didn't end up calling the store where I bought iPad mini from because I do not want to deal with them at all. I do not believe they will be helpful or honest.  So I called att customer service again and was told they couldn't do anything about my iPad mini contract unless I wanted to pay for early termination fee of $146. They did offer to ameliorate the situation by increasing my phone data by 1 GB and reducing the payment by $10. So essentially I would be paying the same amount per month as if I didn't have the iPad mini plan. Plus 1 extra GB. that does make me feel somewhat better. I just wish I didn't have to go thru this in the first place. And I am strongly considering switching to T-Mobile for my cell phone because of my bad experience at this store. MOST IMPORTANTLY:  ALAEDIN BASHITI was the sales rep in the AT&T store that caused all this grief for me.,,1,Yelp

Props to Fernando for taking ownership for correcting a wait list situation. Not sure why the blonde manager failed to step in as she was well aware of the situation. Disorganized and meh service at this location. Save yourself the headache by going to the one off Tollway and Beltline.Credentials: 20 years in service industry,,1,Yelp

The salesman, Lucas, wrote down the quote in easy to understand format. No high pressure sales but he made recommendations based on usage. I got a great plan that was $30 cheaper than I'd been paying and a new phone for my daughter! Ask for Lucas, and he will help you.",,4,Yelp
Dallas9,33.009892,-96.709061,"701 N Central Expy Plano, TX 75075 ",5/7/2013,"I get it; wireless reps work for sales commissions.  All sales reps work for the commission.  What separates a real sales rep from some slick chump are the ones who don't overlook the customer walking in the door looking for quick changes that wouldn't waste more than 5 minutes of the shoulder slung fanny-packed ipad fumbling.  Although the girl who opened the door and welcomed me was friendly; after taking my name and asking what my issue was, I was promptly forgotten for those customers looking to upgrade or buy new phones.  So like a kid in a candy store, I began to fidget with the widgets and touch every phone and demo item in the store. 5 minutes go by, three employees come back for lunch. 10 minutes go by, 2 more come back for lunch, 15 minutes go by and a chewing gym smacking rep nods at me and proceeds to text, who I'd assume is his buddy or girlfriend while leaning on the counter.  So much for the service portion, amIright?  Anyways, here's something to save you 15 minutes of your life: 1800-331-0500 then repeatedly hit 0.  That's the number for AT&T phone customer care, they're open on weekends. It'll get you faster and more courteous service.  I know this because I called this number while standing in store waiting.Or you could head to the local Blue Big Box with the Yellow Tag store slightly north of this place for more friendly, helpful, and less commission hungry service.",,1,Yelp
Dallas9,33.009892,-96.709061,"701 N Central Expy Plano, TX 75075 ",1/25/2014,"I walked in and waited 5 minutes while three different representatives ignored me and helped new entrants to the store. When I did find somebody to assist me she was rude and acted like she was too busy to care. Then I asked if they could solve my problem and she said 'this is not a service center.' I did not know where I was supposed to go but she could have simply said no instead of assuming that I knew where to go and with a rude tone at that. Next she tried to explain to me where the service center was without telling me the phone number, address, or even website once again assuming I knew everything. AWFUL customer service and I would rate 1/2 star if possible.",,1,Yelp

I haven't been here but upon inquiry they had recently remodel and it's more apple store style. My issues were promptly taken cared of in a speedy fashion.  Note to people, customer service will always decrease if they are busy, and corporate policy is different from customer service ability.",,5,Yelp
Dallas9,33.009892,-96.709061,"701 N Central Expy Plano, TX 75075 ",4/5/2014,"I have been to this store on 3 different occasions now and each time I was promptly helped by an energetic, competent, intelligent, articulate, friendly, empathetic salesperson. What else would you want from your customer service representative? Another great thing about this store is that they have a small army of people working and they have tablets in hand so you can run all over the store with them and information necessary to make a decision is always at your / their fingertips. I would take those negative reviews as anomalies. Over time they will become the minority opinion if they keep up the good work here.",,5,Yelp
Dallas9,33.009892,-96.709061,"701 N Central Expy Plano, TX 75075 ",3/11/2013,"So the first and only time I came to this AT&T store was the day the iPhone 5 came out. Granted, not the best day to write a review about a store, but I'm still miffed enough to give my opinion.My mom had gotten me the iPhone 4 two weeks before the iPhone 5 was going to come out, so I immediately called AT&T and asked if I could trade it in and pay the difference. They told me yes, and I had to pay a $30 re-stocking fee.Sure, whatever, I just wanted an iPhone 5 (my first smart phone!) So I called this store around 11 that Friday morning to ask if they had any iPhones left (I had class in the morning) and was told yes, they had a few left. So I raced over to the store, checked in, and eagerly waited. Once I was directed to an employee, I explained my situation. She told me she was not sure that they could do that and went to talk to her manager. Once she came back, she said her manager had approved the request and went on to input the information in the system. And then--screech--""oh, this is the iPhone 4? This is a clearance item, we can't return clearance items.""...I had definitely confirmed with AT&T customer service that I had an iPhone 4 and I was allowed to do the trade-in. She went to talk to her manager again and said he agreed with her and she would not do the exchange. She suggested I go back to the AT&T store where I made the purchase to see if they would do the exchange for me. So I live in Richardson, and I ended up having to drive all the way to Fairview where I did not even ask if they had iPhone 5s available--I just wanted to know if they would trade it in for me. They said yes, they could do that and they did not know why the other AT&T store would not do the exchange.This mess would have been fine except for the vast difference in customer service I experienced in Plano vs Fairview. The Plano store employee was pretty curt and unhelpful, and she would not let me speak to the manager about my situation.",,2,Yelp
Dallas9,33.009892,-96.709061,"701 N Central Expy Plano, TX 75075 ",5/14/2013,"Customer service is terrible. I am just so happy that I ordered my iPhone 5 via AT&T's call center rather than dealing with these lousy people. My iPhone came in the mail and I immediately went to this store to just get a case. That's it. Upon browsing for the particular case I want, it seems that the specific color I need for the brand wasn't there. I stood like an idiot smack in the middle of the store searching for an available employee who can assist me. I'm not exaggerating, but I swear my eyes caught up to 4 employees just standing around in the corner chilling, texting and chatting. I know they know they see me see them - if that makes any sense. Unfortunately, I didn't catch their name, but I was last here late afternoon on Tuesday (05/14). There was a guy there, about 6ft tall, a bit buffed with dark blond hair. I know he saw me and I tried to give out the nonverbal signal that I needed help. He nodded at me and resumed to text on his phone, and started to just hang out by the wall. Am I a non-existent invaluable customer? I guess they didn't take into account that I can write a bad review on one of the most trusted review sites - not that they'd actually care, obviously. They didn't even seem like they wanted to help me. They were rude even when I did talk to them. Anyway, regarding the case I wanted, I took the initiative to approach the people not doing their job and they just said whatever's out is out. Whatever. I just went ahead and bought the next case of choice.",,1,Yelp

Both experiences were extremely negative. When I went to the one near the mall, I spoke with a sales man named Fadi. He was constantly up selling, not listening to our needs what so ever and was completely rude when he was unable to  convince us towards unnecessary products and services. At one point he even physically blocked my husband out of the conversation with his body! It was a pretty terrible and an uncomfortable situation. When I went into Collin Creek Mall, the woman was too busy texting and seemed bothered. As I asked questions about the plan, she continued to text and not make eye contact. When I started to leave, that is when she decided to see if I was looking to start that day....Uh no thanks...",,1,Yelp

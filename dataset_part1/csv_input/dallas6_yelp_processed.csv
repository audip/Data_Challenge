Truly, a wonderful accomplishment.  Flashback to last week.  I had an iphone that I had hastily set up by the customer service rep the day before that was acting up. We thought it was a pretty simple fix and just wanted to double check with them before we fixed it.We show up at 7:30, roughly 1.5 hours until they close.  We explained the simply problem to the customer service rep. Oh boy.  She had no clue what to do and had us get in line.  There were 3 people ahead of us.  We go and mess around on the ipads and wait our turn.  Over an hour goes by.During the hour, we're seeing names disappear from the top of the list.  But we're staying still at 3 behind.  Then my name disappears entirely. It's then that we go to a rep to see what the deal is.  He said that they were looking for me and couldn't find me.  There were only about 10 customers in the store, including us, so they didn't look enough apparently.  And when we begrudgingly asked our simply problem for verification on the solution we had in mind, the rep said ""of course"" and wondered why the other rep even put us in line.They're batting .500 for good experiences, so another good one might bump them to 3 stars.",Negative,100.0000,2,Yelp

I've bought my last 4 new iPhones for our account from this store, but I missed the 14 day return policy to return an unused case that they hard-sold us on but which my son didn't actually want. Were they understanding? I mean I've only been an AT&T customer for 13 years, and had Uverse for something like 6 years. I guess none of that means shit so they basically told me to F off with a smile on their face. Seriously? I was inside one month on the return but hell, the policy is 14 days, and ""they won't let us do anything about that"". Deep breath...at least my immediate call to AT&T's customer service line and a REASONABLE human being got me a bill credit for the $54 the case cost and solved my problem, but if you go here be prepared for a hard sell on the phone case and a glass screen cover so decide in advance if you want it or be prepared to return that stuff stat if you don't. Whew...I feel better venting but what a bunch of inflexible smiling A holes they have who don't give a damn about customer service.

I opened the phone out of the box at an AT&T store at lemon but they did not have another iPhone like it to replace it with.  They said to check out Apple and see if Apple could replace the phone, if Apple shouldn't then they said that this particular AT&T had the phone that I needed in inventory and they should be able to exchange it.Went to Apple and they said that if they replace it and it will shorten the warranty. That physical damage is actually the responsibility of AT&T to exchange. Regarding the exchange policy, this is along the lines of what the AT&T at Lemmon said (they didn't know about the warranty issue). The AT&T at Lemmon actually even put a note concerning this iPhone in the system talking about how it was dead upon arrival and that I should be able to get a new phone. The management here decided to ignore this and just lied to me and say that they couldn't exchange the phone. I don't know if the employees are aware of this or this is coming from the top down but this AT&T store does not understand how things should work concerning Apple phones.

I inquired about an upgrade and he told me I wasn't due for an upgrade until November  (which contradicted what I was told when I first got the phone) then I asked about other options and he shot down all  suggestions and questions. He basically told me that my only option was to pay the remaining amount for my broken phone for $435 and then do another att next deal. Not happening! As he is telling me this he is laughing and grinning with his trainee at my aggravation. I felt as if  he was trying to use me as his case study for a difficult customer. During their grinning and lack of assistance he made several snide remarks such as..... ""well maybe you shouldn't be so rough on your phone and it wouldn't break *stare and giggle*"" and ""it wouldn't break in a case, maybe you should use one"" which I quickly told him it was in a case when it broke. After asking several times for other options, I told him that I have no other choice than to go to another service provider and have them buy me out of my obligations with them and he snickered, nodded his head and said ""I guess so."" Of course I called their headquarters, placed a complaint on him, and was FINALLY helped by someone in customer service who directed me to the ATT Service Center where my phone was fixed for free in 30 mins. Apparently my phone we was still under warranty, which the other guy never bothered to check! He was too busy being a pain in my ***.

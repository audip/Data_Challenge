Someone's always there to open the door for me and check me in if necessary. Today, all I was doing was paying my bills. Ugh  Well u know its not anyone's favorite time but love the kiosks which make it easy. However, not to management. One has been out of order for a month now!!! It be nice if att could fix it and for some reason the other kiosk wanted my password and didn't recognize my # so I had to go look it up. I've been here many times because it's my neighborhood and convenient but I would go here again. I really wonder why all the bad reviews??? Sometimes, I feel like the service is too good cause I'm like ""I just need to pay a bill, no need for anything else"" but they have to greet you and ask it seems. There's always someone standing at the door and opening it for the customers.  Only reason I took off a star is because the kiosk that's out of service and has been for at least one month.",Negative,100.0000,4,Yelp

Now tells me to call AT&T to solve the problem they created. This business has silly policies and employees are not authorized, or incented to make the customer happy. Seems like they simply don't care whether a customer will be back.",Negative,99.9810,1,Yelp
Dallas7,32.8740567,-96.771404,5959 Royal Lane Dallas TX 7523,4/21/2015,Awful service and quite frankly the female service there seems to be an issue. I know the managers are all female here plus a victimized attitude in general in the service industry makes for a bad combo here.....I would hate to use the B word but I maybe would. Hour and a half wait...then I asked if the main checkin person(she) would call one location nearby and I would call the second closest. She basically said no. I have to laugh.,Negative,100.0000,1,Yelp

I waited 45 minutes to talk to someone while 2 employees just sat around and talked. When I finally got help the guy asked me what type of phone I wanted. I told him i phone 6. He said "" which one?"" I asked him what my options were. He then stated, "" man, yall need to get it together. You come in here and don't even know what you want.."" Then proceeded to tell me the options in a condescending manner. I should have walked out but I really needed a phone. I guess they know this and think they can throw any resemblance of customer service out the window. Don't go to this store!",Negative,100.0000,1,Yelp

The employees are rude and one lady was talking bad about a customer to the other employee and the rest of us customers could hear her! Don't know her name but she's a fat curly hair female with a tattoo on her right ankle. Since the employees where incompetent I had to wait an hour to ask the manager a question. Will never come back and advice you not to ever come here.",Negative,100.0000,1,Yelp
Dallas7,32.8740567,-96.771404,5959 Royal Lane Dallas TX 7523,1/21/2014,"The personal at this AT&T location were nice. I stopped by in the afternoon to setup a new AT&T account and it took a matter of minutes. There was no wait, which is a huge plus, because every other AT&T store I walk into I'm always the third or fourth person in line. The employees were friendly, not over talkative and not overly helpful. I would visit this location again due to not having to wait and the speedy service. It did strike me as odd that the personal wasn't a tad nicer, usually even under high pressure the AT&T employees are a bit nicer and a bit more helpful. When the employee was done setting up my account he didn't really say anything to me, just assumed I knew he was done. All in all, it's a good location to get in and out of quickly.",Negative,92.2268,3,Yelp

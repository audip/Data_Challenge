Another ATT store said that I could come into this location, explain the situation, and get it taken care of and walk out with a  new phone. The employees had a very ""don't bother"" attitude about helping customers. It was not busy at all and there were around 5-10 employees available. Michael told me there was nothing they could do (employee). Manager WAS OUT DRINKING so could not override my order. 

When the manager came back, he told me there was nothing they could do. Was not even willing to help much; very condescending. 

I contacted customer service after this experience.

FYI I've been with ATT for 10 years and have never had anything close to this ever happen. This location needs to be cleared out. ",Negative,100.0000,1,Google

With each merger the accountability and customer service has diminished.  At the same time, ATT implements questionable tactics to get rid of customers with older, less profitable rate plans and deceives customers into changing plans by lying about pricing &amp; features.  Any Netflix customer should be concerned about the pending ATT/Directv merger.  This merger will make ATT the largest pay TV provider with substantial broadband reach. \ ATT%  ability to limit competition in online video market will increase. It would be impressive to see consumers unite to file a petition to deny the merger. After the merger ATT would have great power over services like Netflix b/c  they can interfere with the customers use of streaming services  and a company like Netflix wouldn%u2019t have much recourse.

I have gone to this store many times and everyone is very nice.  Only complaint is the seating for those of us who are waiting.  The bench is very unconfortable. I know that several people can sit there at one time, but there is no back and for folks who are more mature or ones who have a bad back, it is not very good.  I understand the space is limited for seating, but perhaps you can re-evaluate the store seating.  Thanks, Barbara Bach

Dallas5,32.8342578,-96.7045404,1152 North Buckner Blvd,Mon Mar 17 14:05:52 +0000 2013," First two reviews pretty much summed up the entire experience. I would like to begin by letting you know that I created a Google Plus account just so that I can warn  about one of the absolute worse experience I have ever had, in any type of consumer environment. If you do plan to ""try it"" then bear this in mind: Everyone in this particular location are sale sharks. Whatever your problem may be, no one employed there treats you like a valued customer. Similar to vicious car salesmen, they only will try to manipulate money out of you. Example: I went in to get an upgrade and was kept being pushed into contracts. When I expressed getting out of the contract, oh well there's a fees. Turns out, when I spoke to corporate, every contract has a 14 day grace period. Once the sales people realized that I wasn't buying the crap they were selling, I started getting attitude! I wasn't being rude, or even out of line, I was simply contesting what they kept telling me. Even when I spoke to the manager about my concerns, she gave me an attitude and was unwilling to help. I work in customer service, and this was pathetic. If I could, based on customer service alone, this location deserves less than even no stars. New rating: negative 5 stars. This store is literally filled with a bunch of pretentious 20 something year olds, hopping around more concerned with goofing off with each other instead of helping customers. So expect 15-45 minute wait regardless of the amount of customers in the store. Also, the individual sales people don't know anything about the products they're pushing so hard to sell. Several times during a conversation the manager needs to be personally asked. Well I'm not surprised since all these assholes care about is the compensation they receive from a sale. If this wasn't connected to a national phone service and it was a personal business, the incompetence and forcefulness of the people on the floor would piss people off enough to complain and the bitchy manager would make sure to permanently destroy the business. I personally warn you to know EXACTLY what you want, and need or expect to be pimped. ",Negative,100.0000,2,Google

I went there to get deposits waived while transferring a bunch of phones to my plan to consolidate our two family plans. The guy who ""helped"" me kept having to go get help from someone then that he couldn't waive the deposit, I insisted that he could do that and back he went to the back of the store. 

Finally he started to do it and informed me of an $18/phone fee for transferring responsibility. I had been told over the phone that I could get that fee waived, so I asked for that. The guy insisted that he ""literally cannot do that."" I pointed to the ""waive fee"" checkbox on his tablet interface and insisted that he could do it. Finally had to talk to a manager who said he would do what I wanted ""tomorrow"" and almost a week later nothing had changed.

The two stars are for the amusement of seeing classic bureaucratic dishonest customer service try to be cool, hip and modern. ",Negative,100.0000,1,Google

Had a 21 day old iPhone 5 with a bad battery and they had NO SOLUTIONS, except..""Can We Make An Appointment For You At The Nearest Apple Store?"". This was after a 45 minute wait. Hey guys....instead of putting people in que as soon as they walk in the door, ask a few intelligent questions. In my case, ""Oh bad battery?

Customers beware make sure the AT&amp;T employees sign your account off those IPads or they will go back and add services after you leave! I called corporate to inform them and they didn't seem like they cared about having a dishonest employee working for them! ,Negative,99.9143,1,Google

There were two employees just standing around -- one wouldn't make eye contact with me, the other was on his cell phone the entire time. I could be wrong, but judging by his tone, he was on a personal call. I'm all about taking breaks at work, but if you're going to take personal calls, good customer service would dictate going off the sales floor. The person that finally helped me was awesome, but I can't say the same for the rest of his co-workers.  ",Negative,99.9935,2,Google

Funny thing is they have three reps standing around doing nutting. When I asked them if they can help me , I was told that they can only do customers check-ins. Came in to exchange a phone before the first 14 days. Ended up canceling my AT&amp;T account and switching to Verizon.  ",Negative,99.9912,1,Google

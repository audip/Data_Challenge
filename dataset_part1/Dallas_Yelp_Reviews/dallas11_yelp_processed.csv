Out of the many AT&T stores I personally visited, the service at this one near the Galleria is up there with the best.I got yet another AT&T phone thanks to my new company, but since Day 1 my phone had been displayed ""You have 6 voicemails"". I pressed ""1"" to call voicemail, and it kept saying the passcode is incorrect. Since our IT guy won't know how to fix this (he is great on all other PC-related issues though lol.. I know he is reading this secretly!), my best bet would be the AT&T store. I made the trip after lunch at around 2ish on a Friday. A representative opened the door and greeted me with her friendly smile, and kindly told me I was the second person in line and my wait time was approximately 5 minutes.I was served by an knowledgeable representative and after he pressed a few buttons on his tablet, my voicemail had been reset. I guess it was okay for me since I don't care about the voicemail already stored in my inbox, but it you do care, tell the representative so he doesn't erase them all.",Negative,99.9998,4,Yelp

Dallas11,32.934372,-96.820672,13710 Dallas Parkway Suite I,7/2/2015,Customer service was not there and the store was not busy at all. The female that I went up to was not helpful at all. This AT&T store usually never lets me down but this time I left the store with my broken phone and without a replacement. I suggest you go up to a worker who is really willing to help you,Negative,96.1810,1,Yelp
Dallas11,32.934372,-96.820672,13710 Dallas Parkway Suite I,3/30/2015,AT&T seems to go out of its way to have the worst customer service. It is almost like they don't want or need me. I come to upgrade my iPhone on a corporate account and in order to backup the phone I need access to their internal network. They tell me the network is slow because there are so many devices connected to the network. The store is empty. There is still a line of people waiting. Keep in mind this is a network company who should have more bandwidth than any other type of company.Second: I just  ordered gigapower. Gigapower is the fiber service designed to compete with google's gigabit service. I get 20 up and 100 down - that is not even close to gigapower. This is what makes people think that marketers are liars. Somewhere in some fine print they will tell you 300 megabit which is not close to 1gb and also far away from what I am actually getting for 120$. Now there is a promotion in my building but they still managed to bill me the full $110 fee. I asked the AT&T store for their help in understanding  the quality of service and see how I can schedule a test and they said gigapower is too new for us and can you call the general number. How disconnected does a company have to be that they cannot help me with u-verse service but have no trouble trying to sell u-verse service in the store. I am now going back to Apple - I think they can help me much better. Wondering why I want to have my corporate account with AT&T. Time to look at Verizon. Next time somebody talks about net neutrality I am going to be sure to point out that if anything AT&T operates like some big government not interested in customer support.,Negative,100.0000,1,Yelp

Dallas11,32.934372,-96.820672,13710 Dallas Parkway Suite I,10/20/2013,"There needs to be less than one star for a company like this.  Here is the saga:Phone drowned in a cup of coffee and we needed a replacement, no worries because it's a Thursday, we're in Vegas and it can be done quickly with all the stores around right? Um, no. So the number was on an account under the ""primary account holder"" who won't release the password, but was willing to release the phone.  Friday morning he walks into an AT&T store in Pennsylvania and releases the phone.  That evening we go into a store in Vegas and try to gain access, but their records show the account wasn't accessed (we were on the phone with him when he was in the store, he told the AT&T minion what he needed).  So we sit on the phone again that evening in the corporate store (3rd store we visited that day since we got referred to two incorrect locations to start) and again he goes through the process of releasing the phone - done!  Now she should be able to buy her own plan or control her number how she wants, right? Nope.  Saturday afternoon we are back in the store trying to figure out how to add her to an existing FamilyTalk plan, we are told it will be $18 and we can either make the ""primary account holder"" in CA walk into a store over there and do it, or we can do it online.  That sounds way better, we'll take time to research replacement phones then do it online since it's so simple.  Come Sunday morning we get online and start the process, only it isn't simple.  The online chat people are all unavailable. Can't even cue for them, just simply grayed out icons.  Then I call... 40 mins and 5 transfers later I'm talking to customer service representative who tells me we still can't transfer her phone to the FamilyTalk plan and keep her number because we don't have the password (remember how releasing the phone was supposed to give her the power to manage her number?  turns out that isn't quite true).  Oh, and the people over the phone can't help me (at a price of $18) because the FamilyTalk plan has a discount through work and the very separate and highly specialized business department at AT&T doesn't work or can't be bothered with client issues on Sundays.  That's exactly what you'd expect to hear from a multi-national corporation right?  And you want to file an official complaint, you expect an online, email, or call-in option for a TECH company? Nope, I'm told to mail a letter to:AT&T Mobility Customer CarePO BOX 755Atwater, CA 95301Sure, that makes sense.  That's exactly what every tech-savy multi-national, multi-billion dollar corporation corporation should be doing demonstrate their commitment to customer care.  This needs a very, very hard re-think by AT&T.  It's really no wonder that they rank at the bottom of customer care in every region of the country. The cell service is fine, but taking 3 days to jump through all of their hoops, get conflicting information about what needs to be done, and ultimately end up with nothing is disrespectful to their client base.",Negative,100.0000,1,Yelp

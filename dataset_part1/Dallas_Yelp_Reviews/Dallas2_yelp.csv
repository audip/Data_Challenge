I went into the AT&T Store (don't remember who helped me) and picked up my new phone and went through the phone's initial boot process with him. It wasn't until I walked out that I realized that the representative helping me failed to transfer the plan I had before to the new phone. I had walked out with no data plan, no texting ability at all, and a talk plan that would be similar to the senior plan AT&T offers. My grandfathered unlimited plan was gone!I ended up having to call AT&T and it took days for them to fix what the representative at the store screwed up. Next time I am looking to 'upgrade', it won't be at this store as that representative almost cost them a customer who's been with AT&T for 20 years. That representative got a nasty 'review' when AT&T did their ""how did we do"" automated follow-up call the next day..My Phone also came with a defective charging cable. Rather than step foot back in that store, I bought a new one from monoprice(dot)com for $2. All-in-All, I love AT&T, but I won't ever step foot in that store location again.",,1,Yelp

She flat out lied, as I have come to figure out.I only get 1G, and they automatically charge my account $20 when I use it up, and only to add just 1 more! I have only had service with AT&T for less than 2 months, and I'm already regretting my decision. I called to address the issue several times, but AT&T's response (both in-store and over the phone) was that they wouldn't honor what their own associate assured me they I would be getting. The manager at the Oak Lawn location where I bought the phone wouldn't even return my calls on the matter. The first time I called, he said he'd look info the issue and see what he could do. Here I am a week later still waiting on that phone call.  So AT&T is clearly a bunch of bait & switch thieves who don't honor their word.

TV bundle services or mobile.But this time it is about their ""trade-in"" program for used cell phones.  My husband uses AT&T and decided that instead of using Gizelle (whom I love and have sold several phones to) he wanted to try the AT&T's  trade-in program.  They offered $200 dollars for my husband iPhone 4, 64gb as a AT&T only cash card.  Not a Visa or MC just a AT&T store card or on-line purchase card.  I wanted to sell it to Gizelle even though they were offering $75 less.  Because I know how quickly Gizele sends your cash for your phone.  It is ultimately a no hassle program and they are very friendly.Well, the moral of story is that AT&T has your phone after you've mailed it to them for now a month plus a few days and still can't give you an answer as to when you'll get the AT&T cash card.  When you track it on-line the ""status"" still says ""phone not received"" even though when you call them they say that they have it. ????  On top of all of that they are not very friendly matter-of-factly they are rude.

It is to my understanding that members of the sales team benefit  when they convince you to upgrade on a sale. while I almost expect them to attempt to confuse me in order to make a bigger sale, I was told that the money I have been under the impression I have been paying towards insurance was actually an ""access fee"" (whatever that is) and that my only option was to ""finance"" a phone for hundreds of dollars(this would have made my bill go up $40 a month). I leveled with him and told him I know I have insurance, and he again gave me the same run around about two different costly options and ignored my insurance question. I went home and did a little research, realized I DO have insurance and it was right there on my account fees from att. So I went to the site listed (phoneclaim.com/att) and they already had my account info. It took MINUTES and they are sending me a brand new upgraded phone for $99 (The price I had remembered being quoted at the att store when I bought my phone AND insurance).

Um, no. So the number was on an account under the ""primary account holder"" who won't release the password, but was willing to release the phone.  Friday morning he walks into an AT&T store in Pennsylvania and releases the phone.  That evening we go into a store in Vegas and try to gain access, but their records show the account wasn't accessed (we were on the phone with him when he was in the store, he told the AT&T minion what he needed).  So we sit on the phone again that evening in the corporate store (3rd store we visited that day since we got referred to two incorrect locations to start) and again he goes through the process of releasing the phone - done!  Now she should be able to buy her own plan or control her number how she wants, right? Nope.  Saturday afternoon we are back in the store trying to figure out how to add her to an existing FamilyTalk plan, we are told it will be $18 and we can either make the ""primary account holder"" in CA walk into a store over there and do it, or we can do it online.  That sounds way better, we'll take time to research replacement phones then do it online since it's so simple.  Come Sunday morning we get online and start the process, only it isn't simple.  The online chat people are all unavailable. Can't even cue for them, just simply grayed out icons.  Then I call... 40 mins and 5 transfers later I'm talking to customer service representative who tells me we still can't transfer her phone to the FamilyTalk plan and keep her number because we don't have the password (remember how releasing the phone was supposed to give her the power to manage her number?  turns out that isn't quite true).  Oh, and the people over the phone can't help me (at a price of $18) because the FamilyTalk plan has a discount through work and the very separate and highly specialized business department at AT&T doesn't work or can't be bothered with client issues on Sundays.  That's exactly what you'd expect to hear from a multi-national corporation right?  And you want to file an official complaint, you expect an online, email, or call-in option for a TECH company? Nope, I'm told to mail a letter to:AT&T Mobility Customer CarePO BOX 755Atwater, CA 95301Sure, that makes sense.  That's exactly what every tech-savy multi-national, multi-billion dollar corporation corporation should be doing demonstrate their commitment to customer care.  This needs a very, very hard re-think by AT&T.  It's really no wonder that they rank at the bottom of customer care in every region of the country. The cell service is fine, but taking 3 days to jump through all of their hoops, get conflicting information about what needs to be done, and ultimately end up with nothing is disrespectful to their client base.",,1,Yelp

I was out of town and nowhere near a AT&T store, so as soon as I got back in town, I went to this AT&T store by my home. All of my issues were resolved within 30 minutes, and it was a breeze. Jared Johnson, the rep I usually speak with, was busy, so Lazaro helped me, and he was so nice and knew what he was talking about. He was quick, efficient, and never tried to rush me. AT&T phone support has always been TERRIBLE so it's best just to go to the store, makes life so much less stressful.My only warning is to get there when the store opens. I got there at 10:05am (it opened at 10am on a Monday morning) and was already put on a wait list, then 4 people came in right after me...yikes!

I usually hate going to a brick and mortar store for anything because I have always had the experience and the perception that sale associates are going to: 1) pressuring me to buy additional services 2) ""forgetting"" to remove additional options so they gain a bit of commission. Fortunately, the sales associates here went up, over, and beyond my expectations. I walked up and I had two greeters open the doors for me. I felt as if I was a royalty just with the first initial contact. Instantly, they greeted me (with a genuine tone!) and I gave them an explanation of my situation and they went to work immediately. Paul, who was the person that was assigned to help me did a great job of strong arming AT&T's ""Premier"" business division into releasing the number I was trying to port and escalated the situation with their division heads to expedite the process of releasing my ported number. 30 minutes later, I got the phone I wanted with all the corporate discounts I needed and only spent a few extra bucks to boot. (which I happily paid to have my phone on the spot). I walked out of there feeling pretty boss. Even the lady expediting the release of my ported number said ""don't worry, we won't let this division bully you."" Such endearment! About a week later, I got my first bill... I had some charges that were due to ghost line I had set up to hold my account. I went up there and was greeted like royalty again. Tina was assigned to help me out! She was took a look at my billing situation and within a few minutes, the billing issue was resolved. She did it all while joking around with me about all the products they had.

After our dog knocked an entire glass of water on my BB, I decided it was time to upgrade. I just got back from this AT&T store and man...it was so easy!I'm still currently a Tmobile customer and walked in not knowing what to do. Thankfully Rudy was there to help me as soon as I opened the doors! He escorted me to the desk, where I gave him a couple of bits of information that he entered. Ten minutes later, he was downloading my address book and pictures from the BB to my new iPhone.Rudy showed me how to do the simple things on my new phone, a few hints and tips, and gave me his card with his personal cell phone on it in case I have any problems. He was even able to show me how much my first bill is going to be, as well as the following bills. I had no questions walking out today.The best part -- I was outta there in less than twenty minutes -- wham, bam, thank you ma'am!! (I mean, sir)",,5,Yelp

Dallas2,32.8111091,-96.8092962,3329 Oak Lawn Avenue Dallas TX 75219,10/11/2013,AT&T is the worst company ever! I have been a customer for over 10 years and they have managed to screw me again. I made a payment arrangement and today I discover my phone is cut off. I call to talk to them and all they can tell me is I made a payment arrangement on the 9th of October for the 9th of October. WHY WOULD I DO THAT? I made the arrangement for the 21st. I advise no one to use AT&T. They wont help me even tho I have been a customer for over 10 years. And they want me to pay the reconnect fee. They obviously don't care about their customers.,,1,Yelp
Dallas2,32.8111091,-96.8092962,3329 Oak Lawn Avenue Dallas TX 75219,8/11/2013,Beware of their sales tactics. Went to have my uverse moved to a new location. The sales associate was very discouraging on a transfer and insistent on opening a new account. I ask for the manager and he was no help. Obviously they want you to set up a new account for some financial gain to them. You lose your number and there is an external credit check if you set a new account up. After 20 min of arguing with ten about transferring my account a walked out without accomplishing anything. Once again horrible service from AT&T.  I think it is time for Charter Cable and Sprint simply everything plan for my cell! Time to say goodbye to poor service from AT&T!,,1,Yelp
Dallas2,32.8111091,-96.8092962,3329 Oak Lawn Avenue Dallas TX 75219,1/30/2013,"We were in the store recently and were trying to switch a cell phone to a land line. Sounds strange, but this phone number has been in the family for over 50 years (minus the area code of course). We had a recent death in the family, so it was important we keep the number; we explained all of this to JJ, who provided the absolute best customer service. We were there for 2 hours, and while this is a long time, JJ was on his feet the whole time helping us every way he could. First AT&T wanted to charge us a cancellation fee for the cell phone, which doesn't make sense since the person passed away. He managed to go around that fee, as well as others, and we finally got the number switched. He was pleasant the whole time, making small talk with us, making us laugh and it really didn't seem like 2 hours. People like JJ are few and far between! Top notch customer service",,5,Yelp

However, a guy named Fernando greeted us, took care of us, and was the most helpful, laid back, easy going guy I've ever met working at a cell phone place. My GF and I both left talking about how great he was, and what a relief it was to be taken care of by a guy who seemed to genuinely care and want to be helpful. I'll always go back here and ask for him when I need help with cell phone stuff.",,5,Yelp

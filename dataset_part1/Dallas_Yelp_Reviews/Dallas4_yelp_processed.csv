Dallas4,32.8685017,-96.7757012,8687 N Central Expressway Suite 2340,9/12/2015,"I don't know where to start with this one..My service & upgrade experiences have been awful the last few years. AT&T is not the same company it was years ago. My family has been using AT&T for 25+ years.. Through multiple name changes and all.So today I wanted to upgrade my iPhone 5s. Today Sept 12th is the pre-order day for the iPhone 6s. My 2 year contract expires on sept 20th.Naturally one would think, hey I can order the phone today and by the time it comes in (2-3 weeks if I'm lucky) then I'll be past the 2 year upgrade day.Nope, not with AT&T. The employee told me i would have to wait until the 20th to order the phone... Seriously? Eight fucking days?And fuck this ""next"" program they have.. Why would I want to lease a cell phone, and not only that.. It's $25 a month with a 30 month commitment. I want to buy the phone. Sell me the fucking phone.Not only that but the employee lied to my face, I tried to go upgrade early a few months ago and was told ""oh we can only bend that by a week or two"" well what's the issue with letting me ORDER A FUCKING PHONE eight days before my upgrade date?Get your shit together AT&T.. Pathetic customer service.",Negative,100.0000,1,Yelp

They deactivated my Dad's cell phone after I took his upgrade even though I told them to be cognizant of not doing that (mentioned it to them MULTIPLE times)! My dad is traveling for business WITHOUT any cell service, land line or wifi because he is in a remote location. Apparently once you deactivate a sim card you can not turn it back on. BUT NOBODY TOLD ME THAT! They simply said that they opened up an IT ticket with support and it would be turned on between 20min and 2hrs. NOPE! Instead, we have spent 2.5 hours on the phone with ATT and found out well past the time that all the stores closed. Go somewhere else if you need to do anything! Not worth dealing with these idiots who don't care about putting others in a bad situation. By the way, the associates were Missy and Will. Steer clear.",Negative,100.0000,1,Yelp

I walked in to return a phone case that I had purchased somebody for Christmas and I was told ""we'll put you in queue. The current wait time is 30 mins."" I'm sorry, 30 mins to make a return? I can see this working for new phone sales, etc. but in no way should returns be put in the same queue as new activations.",Negative,99.9861,2,Yelp
Dallas4,32.8685017,-96.7757012,8687 N Central Expressway Suite 2340,8/9/2010,"a month ago I came to the store for rates with questions about switching over for the iphone 4. Oh lucky me, I got the worse employee they have there, the manager. She was not helpful at all!. She gave me a plan packet and told me to look at it. I was like hello? I have questions to ask. and I can this off the website, duh! So anyway, I asked her what I should do if I want to switch over. So she told me I would have to open a temporary number and that I would have to pay for tmobile and the att temporary number. I was a little confused, why would I need two different numbers for? I'm not a drug dealer or asking for booty calls from anonymous people. ugh! and she kept telling me I had to get two iphone plans. Well, I was planning on getting a family plan with one iphone, not two! my mom is an old Asian lady, she's old school, so having an iphone would just confuse her too much. and besides, I wouldn't do that to my poor mother! lol Well, I got the feeling she didn't know what she was talking about so I went home and called att hotline myself. I had to spend extra time researching when she could have helped me the first time. Some customer service she has...hey ATT, you need to upgrade your manager, ASAP! story short, I switched over but girl who handled my account didn't sign me up for unlimited texting after I told her several times I wanted unlimited texting. She even wrote it down on a piece of paper! anyway, She put me on a 250 limit texts...wth? I use about 200 texts a day! so by day three, sure enough, I got a warning text saying I went over my texting limit plus 50 bucks. FIFTY DOLLARS? oh no, I dont think so! I called them back and they admitted that it was their fault so now they're going to take it off my bill when it comes in. Guess who's going to see the bill first when it comes in? MY MOM! she's going to have a big headache and yell at me. Our bill is going to be like $300 lol then I have to struggle with my vietnamese and try to explain to her what they did because she doesn't understand english that well. UGH OH JOY! fmlALL THIS FOR AN IPHONE! which I do absolutely LOVE btw!",Negative,100.0000,2,Yelp
,,,,5/28/2012,"Went to this store, referred from another store who didn't have the capability to handle my account change request. Had a short wait time and then was met by Michael, who had a helpful, can-do attitude and was able to handle my moderately complex account change without problem. I was very satisfied with the service and would go back to this store without hesitation.",Positive,84.7843,4,

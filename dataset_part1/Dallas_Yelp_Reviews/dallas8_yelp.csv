We initiated a Release of Responsibility with the Corporate Customer Service folks (my girlfriend was on a Family Plan with her sisters and Mom), and were told to visit the Corporate Store to setup a new account with my girlfriend's recently released number. We were not helped for over fifteen minutes, despite checking in and making an appointment at 3:00pm and arriving five minutes early. Anne (Wisconsin native) greeted us and took us through the ""don't of Customer Service"" for twenty odd minutes... It was a hellish nightmare. The lady was as coarse as she was dull and lacking the correct policies and information. She stressed us out so badly that I pulled Eric, the GM, aside and explained our frustration with Anne, that she would be receiving negative feedback, and all he could do at this point was save the sale. He quickly came to our aide and made a point to dismiss Anne rather subtly after correct her mistakes right in front of her--epic. He got everything back-on-track and also pulled Evan, a pleasant, chirpy and      hilarious Sales Rep from the back. Our time with Evan was awesome and even turned our entire two hours there around. He was sympathetic to our struggles with Anne and went far out of his way to make us comfortable!My fellow LA native! Cali Boys UNITE!",,3,Yelp

Organization organizational skills are terrible. They have a numbering system for walk-in customers, but they call people out of order. Not just out party, but multiple other patrons in the store that we talked to as well. Not sure if certain employees have restricted access with which customers they can help, but there are multiple employees walking around not doing anything. Employees are hesitant to give detailed answers when you approach them with the issue.",,1,Yelp

Here's my feedback of how that conversation went : The rep was extremely rude after a few Initial discussions. She kept rushing me and  suggested that I should hang up on my husband who I was talking to simultaneously so we could decide to buy t new iPhone. She hit on ""I accept"" option when it should have been me; just to hurry me up, it was abt 8.30 so may be was in a hurry to go home. She told me not to read the disclaimers because they were available online and could be read out of the store. She got so pushy that at one pony I had to ask her to relax. I almost walked out of the store without purchasing the phone because of her. But stuck through as I had waited for an HR to even talk to a rep n she didn't have the courtesy to talk to a client who was investing 650 dollars on a phone.",,1,Yelp

                Updated review",***NOT ONLY THIS PLACE CANNOT HELP YOU BUT THEY WILL MAKE THINGS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR YOU. YOU MIGHT AS WELL CALL CUSTOMER CARE INSTEAD OF WALKING INTO THIS STORE***Horrible Service and you can find the least knowledgeable customer executives here.It was a pain to get the connection from these people as a first time user few months ago and now when I walked in for an upgrade they tell me I am not the account holder on my own account and wanted me to call customer care. Why would I do that If I knew you guys would not be of any help in store to me?. If you think you have enough time to take their BS go out there and wait for hours while they eventually come back after an hour telling you that only customer care can help you with your case. This is another disappointing experience within a span of  4-6 months. I would never visit this store ever again and not recommend it either.THANK YOU AT&T . PLEASE DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT SUCH STORES AND I BET YOU WILL GET MORE IRATE CUSTOMERS LIKE ME,,1,Yelp

Long wait times, worker's upset doing customer service, cause I know they rather sell something for their commission, and I left asking more questions then answers that I got. It's AT&T  nothing has change, customer service is poor, but the service is dependable I can say I had no problems yet.",,2,Yelp
Dallas8,32.913273,-96.958064,7800 N. Macarthur Boulevard Suite 150,8/28/2015,"I decided at 4PM yesterday that I finally wanted to upgrade from my iPhone 5 to the iPhone 6. I was going to drive to the Lewisville location but when I found out that there was an AT&T store not too far from my apartment, I went there instead.I did scan some of the reviews on Yelp and was bracing myself to wait for a very long time and to interact with some rude representative. Fortunately for me, I didn't have to do either of those things.I arrived around 6PM on a Thursday. There were maybe a dozen customers there already but everyone was being helped. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted and asked what I was there for. I told her that I was interested in getting a new phone and immediately I was introduced to Fatima. We walked to the back of the store to sit down and we discussed what I was wanted. She made sure every one of my questions were answered. And when she tried to sell me extras she didn't make me feel like I was being pressured to say yes.After maybe 45 minutes, I was done. Quick and painless.I have been an AT&T customer for almost a decade now and while they do piss me off as a greedy as fuck corporate entity, I have never received poor customer service. Thanks to Fatima for solidifying my continued positive experience with AT&T.",,3,Yelp

Went to the store to ask about blacklist my lost phone using IMEI number - the representative said : AT&T cant do anything like blacklist/erase/locate and asked me to work with any third party site to blacklist ... I didn't believe this store , so then called AT&T service center - they were able to blacklist the lost one.

Macarthur Boulevard Suite 150,6/15/2015,"This is for the AT&T support store that is adjacent to the sales shop.I came here to get my phone checked as it would die as soon as I unplugged from the charger, even though, it showed the charge above 95%.James, the service guy suspected it to be a battery problem and luckily he had the same phone as mine. So, he checked by swapping the batter and it did indeed work for mine and his failed to start.So, I was offered a free battery that would be shipped withing 4-5 business days. However, I was moving and told them I can't wait for that long and said thanks and prepared myself to go somewhere to find the battery impromptu. Apropos, the manager, listening to all the conversation, offers to check if they could deliver it overnight. As it happens, they could. So, I am waiting for a FREE charger, overnight delivery from a AT&T; courtesy of James and the manager whose name I forgot.I rarely gets this level of service anywhere and any business type. I think, it was not just be. I witness the same level of attention and service to other patrons as I was waiting for the paperwork.I rarely give five stars; and this one really deserves it.",,5,Yelp

Macarthur Boulevard Suite 150,1/25/2014,"AT&T is a telecom company that sells wireless, TV, and home network services.  This AZT&T is attached to an AT&T service center that also handles support issues.   This is a review for both.My Overall Rating:AT&T Retail - 3  1/2 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Facility, Return)AT&T Support - 3 Stars (Service, Facility, Return)Atmosphere - Retail - You're greeted at the door a huge floor showcasing technology.  It's really great and gives you the same vibe heading into a car dealership.  Lots of nice shiny toys await!  1 Star.Support - Usually there's a line, and customers there looks tired, bored, or like they would rather be somewhere else.  Look, if you're here chances are your phone is broken so expect a darker mood.  No Stars.Service - Retail - You are greeted at the door and signed in.  Once it's your turn, a sales associate will help you with all your needs.  For the most part they are helpful.  What I find is they're not really that objective, and tend to try to steer you to the most expensive device, not the one that's best for you.  One poor lady had an iPhone 3GS, and wanted something basic and similar.  Instead of offering the iPhone 5c, he insisted she HAD to get a 5s with NEXT.  Also, if you are in the U-verse zip code, expect a STRONG pitch.  Even if you say no they will persist.  But they are friendly in my experiences.  The last thing that is slightly annoying is you'll be reminded to fill out a survey.  Some associates have really pushed to make sure you'll give them a good score.  Guess what?  If you're honest & helpful you'll get great scores, so stop pressuring me.   1/2 Star.Support - Usually it's a really long wait, but once you get to a tech they're very helpful.  Unfortunately I have had to use them several times, and except for the wait, they're very professional and will do what they can within your contract.  1  1/2 Star.Facility - Retail - This AT&T store has a great layout.  It's a very open space, with individual tables for customers, a few couches to watch U-Verse, and several areas showcasing their phones and technology.  It doesn't feel cramped and is quite refreshing.  It would be nice to have more seats for waiting when it gets busy. 1 Star.Support - Pretty much just a room with two long benches for waiting.  At least you can watch TV.  1/2 Star.Will I Return? - Yes (to both).  As far as the retail side goes, I'm an A&T customer and they seem to have the best phones.  Although they are expensive and will push U-verse and NEXT on you, the associates are friendly.  Also, the Support team (once it's your turn) are professional and will try to do whatever they can for you.  It would be nice if all phones lasted forever, but it is what it is.  1 Star.My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.2 Stars - Service - You can have a great car with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the experience that service is great and on point.1 Star - Facility - I'll award 1 stars for the facility, since this is one reason we go out.  1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except service (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.",,3,Yelp

And even after her obvious sighs, blank stares, and eye rolls, my husband still had the decency to apologize for having to re ask a question he didn't quite get the entire answer to.  I understand I have no way of knowing how many rude customers she had before us, but I do know that we are the type of customers that usually make you hate your job less.   Thank you for your service today Miss Moody MAGGIE.We will not be back.Also, just wanted to add, this review is a first, and I actually downloaded yelp just to create this review.",,2,Yelp

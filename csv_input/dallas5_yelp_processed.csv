Dallas5,32.8342578,-96.7045404,1152 North Buckner Blvd,1/8/2014,"This is the AT&T store closest to my home. Stopped by because in switching to a new IPhone 5 the messaging part got dropped. Not their fault. Got the phone at SAMs (a word to the wise, don't do that). They helped resolve the problem although I did have to do it with headquarters, not the personnel in store. Problem fixed. Personnel were very helpful and not much of a wait -- weekday noon. Let me repeat, be wary of signing up for things at SAMs if it can be done otherwise. We had a similar (and ongoing) problem with DIRECTV that we also signed up for at SAMs.",Negative,99.9579,4,Yelp
Dallas5,32.8342578,-96.7045404,1152 North Buckner Blvd,11/15/2014,"OMG I went into this store with my ATT 5S phone in hand. I was traveling and forgot my car charger and I really needed one! Told the man what I needed Now this us where I made a big mistake, I tested he sold the correct car charger. ASSuming one can do his job, well I forget I am old school. I get down I-45 to Corsicana before I plugged in my phone, yes that is correct he sold me the wrong car charger. When I got to Houston where I now live, it took me a few days to get over to an ATT store to make an exchange. Yes folks you guessed it....they would not make an exchange because it had been longer than three days. I haven't idea How much money I have spent with ATT and how long I have had my ATT Phone to THEM that doesn't even matter. I have spent $ $ $ with ATT. If I could take my phone and service and cram it up someone's nose I would. They have no customer service at all and have no idea what it means.",Negative,100.0000,1,Yelp
Dallas5,32.8342578,-96.7045404,1152 North Buckner Blvd,7/8/2014,"I would like to warn ATT customers to avoid this store if possible.  They have very good sales staff that confound the issues and market in ways that are confusing at best.  I have spent a lot of time and money straightening up what I thought I purchased and what I really purchased.  A word of caution, buy your phone at the Apple Store, buy your ATT services online.  This ATT store protocols can end up being a nightmare for you.  I wish there were zero stars because that's exactly what it would get.  You will spend hours on the phone with ATT service people who will apologize profusely for taking your money.",Negative,100.0000,1,Yelp

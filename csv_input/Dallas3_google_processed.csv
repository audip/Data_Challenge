They have a television in there and a small seating area for customers on the wait list. Chris hooked me up with a new device and had answers for all of my questions. He walked me through the process and made sure I had everything I needed to start using the phone ASAP. Great customer service experience here. ,Positive,63.1420,4,Google

Oscar told me they couldn't open the cabinet with the phones (lie) and sent me to the store on Oak Lawn.  I got all the way down there only to find that they had 10+ people waiting for service.  I went back to this location only to find that I now had people in line ahead of me.  I waited around for half an hour with no change in line status.  I had just decided to keep AT&T as a provider and not switch to another carrier but good old Oscar changed my mind for me due to poor customer service!!! ,Negative,100.0000,1,Google

I did homework and could afford to do it for the phone I wanted. I told the sales person what I wanted to do and he wouldn't even try to do anything. Wost sales person I have ever encountered. I don't recommend this store at all.
It was like he didn't even want to try and help me.  ",Negative,100.0000,1,Google

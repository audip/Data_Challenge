A few hours later, I tried to look up my cell phone account and they had all disappeared and inaccessible.  I called AT&T customer service but the person on the phone said he didn't know why.  I called up the store, and asked to speak to the manager: Clinton Brower. Over the phone, he asked for my internet username and password.  I've never heard of anyone asking for a private password over the phone.  I told him that I would rather come in person.  I went there, and after spending an hour there with Clinton and Casey, neither could fix my account.  So basically, I've wasted 2 hours of my time on the phone and in the store for a problem created by AT&T.  And, to top it off, Clinton offers up a 25% discount on a iPhone case for all my troubles.  Insult to injury.  Not only, did the Oak Lawn store somehow managed to make my account inaccessible, and then unable to fix it, the manager instead offering me a credit to my account decided to give a $7 discount on a cheap but overpriced case for me to actually buy.  Now that's ""customer service""!  Good luck to all that visit this store.  Don't expect serious help. ",,3,Google

I went in for a question I had about my account (I have been an AT&T customer for over 9 years). Cannot believe his tone and attitude, my guess is due to the fact that my question was not going to generate a commission for him. Way to go on the customer service AT&T,  just gave me another reason to switch. ",,1,Google

The one I was originally interested was out of stock, but that's ok because it had just come out earlier this month and I decided I didn't really want that one anyway. All was well until I got home and tried to put my MicroSD card in my new phone. Bryan had forgotten to put the SIM tool back in the box. I went to the store the next day and Bryan was not there, but I talked to Lupe. She said Samsung no longer puts SIM card tools in their boxes. She did not believe me or my companion when we said we saw Bryan take it out of the original box (later I did research online and it said that the SIM tool does come in the box). Anyway, she gave us an old Nokia SIM tool and I was happy to get what I came for, but a little perturbed by her conversation with us. Today, I checked my email, and there's an email thanking me for signing up for AT&T Mobile Insurance on my new cell phone. I was not told about that and I did not want that plan which added $7.99/month to my bill. I love my phone, but I am not happy with my experience at this AT&T Store. ",,2,Google

It wasn't empty so we expected to wait a little bit, and we did. We walked around for about 15 minutes, everything was working, clean, they let me use their restroom, and then we were assisted by a rep. Rep was average, she had to ask the manager for the differences between plans, but maybe she was new, but she was nice. We were in and out in 45 minutes. ",,3,Google

Excellent service, I was met at the door and within minutes of checking in a representative introduced himself, Jon, he knew exactly what I needed and was quick. He got me a new sim card and loaded it for me.  I was literally out of the store within 15 min. of entering. I could of easily picked up the sim card and done this all myself but Jon was eager to assist so I let him do it there in the store.

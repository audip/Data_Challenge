Over $1800 worth of equipment

in june a technician came and installed my service. Once completed he told me that he couldnt install the light switches due to him not being a licensed electrician and advised me to call customer service. I had some remodeling done to my house so i called and scheduled the handy man to come in the begining of july and thats when everything went down hill. 

The tech came at the scheduled time, when he showed up he said "" i dont know what went wrong but you need a handy man i can not help you, so he put in an order for a handy man to come in couple of days later.

couple of days later samething happened a tech came and said i dont know what went wrong but you need a handy man. 

So after three times of sending the wrong people. A handy man showed up august 11. he was supposed to show up at 4 but he showed up at 8 PM. he installed the switches and asked me to try one out, i asked him how can i dim my lights he said "" OH these are ions or something of that sort and you can only turn them on and off and not dim them."" he advised me to call customer service and left after installing 19 out of the 20 switches. 

Next day my lights started acting up. The minute you turn on the lights they turn back off in my kitchen and entry way. and 7 out of the switches have not been syned.

Thats fine i call customer service they send a tech and again "" i dont know what happened you need a handy man, call customer service and tell them that they sent you the wrong switches. I said ok, i called customer service and then got transfered 3 times until i got someone that said ok we will come and replace them. an hour before installation the supervisor calls and tells me that i have no handy man is available we will reschedule, i said ok.

Today again an hour before installation the tech calls me and informs me that i need a handy man so i told him that when i talked to support they said they will send one, so he said he is going to call robert his supervisor. 5 min later he calls me and tells me that if i want the dimmers i have to purchase them again full price and that i need to pay an electrician to come and install them. i told him thats not what they told me at support so he advised me to call. So i call again and after 1.5 hours the lady tells me to pay  $20 extra per switch and someone between 4 and 7 will come and install so i agreed. GUESS WHAT. i get a call back before installation and the gentleman tells me that there is no order for a handy man and that i should pay my electrician to come and install them, so i put him on three way with support and they told him to get a handy man, well wait its too late now you have to wait another 3 business days before a handy man comes and installs them. 

I told the lady ( Fellan ) her name that i want to cancel the service because they couldnt deliver the product, so she states that i have to pay an early termination fee of 631 dollars. Wait What???!??!?!?!

1. They sent the wrong switches
2. I have been waiting for 1.5 month 
3. My lights in my brand new built house are not working 
4. i still have to pay for that.???? 
5. not to mention that this is how they left my house

Yes sir you have to, i will try to get a supervisor to call you but that usually takes 24-48 hours..
SO now im stuck with equipment worth $1800 dollars that dont work and on top of that i cant enjoy my house because my lights are not working

This is my story:
In January of this year, I moved to my current address. In the process of moving, I contacted several cable providers to see which one I would want to use in my new apartment. I contacted Comcast, AT&T, and DirecTV. After deciding that I wanted to stay with Comcast, I went forward with them and they installed my cable. The AT&T representative that I spoke to on the phone kept calling me back, because we never finished discussing anything about installation or prices - I was only wanting some general information about the service they provide. She continued to call me back and I never responded because I didn't want the service. She should have taken the fact that I didn't respond as an obvious sign that I was not interested; instead, she used my information to create an AT&T account, and set me up for an installation that I never asked for or agreed to. A few days later, I received a call from AT&T saying that I was scheduled for an installation. I told them that I never asked for one, and that I didn't want AT&T's service because by that point, I had Comcast. They asked if I wanted to cancel the installation, and I said yes so they did. About a month later, AT&T sends me a bill - for what, I do not know. I NEVER installed their service in my home, so how was I being billed for something that I never used? That same day, February 19th, I called AT&T and explained my situation. They could not find an account under my name because I never had one, so they could not figure out how I was being billed. After being on the phone with them for over two hours, I finally spoke to their supervisor, who apologized for the inconvenience I was experiencing.... but guess what? I'm STILL being billed by these crooks. I have taken this issue to people with a lot of power who can help me! ",Negative,100.0000,1,Google

So then tech #3 calls and, once again, you have to be home. He then checks the same stuff the other two techs checked (at your house) and then leaves, and in my case didn't even call me back to tell me if it was fixed or not.

Called the DSL department and they could not find a balance either. Kept getting bills without a balance. Called AT&T about the collections, they said it was fraudulent and not to pay. So I didn't. Finally after 6 months of harassment, I write a letter to the finance department and they get to the bottom of it. It takes days of calls and a million transfers to finally find the accounts overdue. I pay them off immediately. They REFUND the money for one of the accounts and apologize for my trouble. A month later, I get a bill asking for the money back. If you wanted the money why didn't you just keep it?! I'm so sick and tired of wasting my time writing letters to everybody, holding on the phone, and trying to fix my credit with the bureaus. Now I'm expecting my first child and have nowhere to live because I can't lease with this terrible credit. All because of AT&T. I will never hire this company again if it was the last  in the planet.

I was moving about a mile away from my previous apartment.  I called and scheduled a transfer to the new place for the first day I was to move in.  I was informed my modem wouldn't work at the new place and I would be required to rent one, I'm not happy about this, but I had other things to worry about with the move.

So the technician shows up and informs me that he needs to wait on another technician before he can start.  Long story short, the other guy never showed up.  He advised me  to just schedule for another day.  I do this, but they can't come out for another week.  Next week, a technician shows up, he says he can start but can't complete the job until another technician shows up.  We wait 5 hours and another no show.  He says the other guy just needs to do something outside and is scheduled to come by and I'll be notified when it's done.

Then it gets really bad, I start getting voicemails everyday asking me to call in and schedule an installation.  When I return the call I'm advised I don't need to schedule an installation, just keep waiting and a technician should be out within a few days to complete.  Everyday I get voicemails.  It always goes to voicemail because the iphone 5 AT&T charged me out the nose for typically doesn't ring and I miss the majority of my calls.  After dozens of phone calls back and forth, now all of a sudden, they can't pull up my account when I give them my number.  This culminates with a call center experience around the world speaking with Americans, Indians, etc.  This call ends after 38 minutes when I realized the 4th time I've been transferred it's been to the wrong department.

Many, many calls later, and dealing personally with an AT&T rep who my apartment building pays to assist the residents to get service, we finally determine the number they have on file for me was altered by one digit.  I ask for this to be corrected and once again schedule a technician to come out.  Well it appears customer service has my correct number, but the technician doesn't.  So he can't contact me.  A 4th technician is scheduled to come out and I ask he's given the correct number, he is not.  He shows up and can't contact me.

I'm nearing 4 weeks since I moved, around 50 phone calls, 4 technician visits, 2 where I let them in my apartment, and still no service yet.  Meanwhile I'm racking up huge data bills on my phone, which doesn't ring when friends and family and technicians call.  I'm being told I will be forced to rent a modem (no option of buying) that has a ranking on Amazon of 2 starts and runs for about $20 to buy outright.

Also, I haven't even seen a bill in over year since I switched to paperless billing.  Now when I login, I need to synch my Uverse bill to my cellphone bill.  Guess what?  I gave up trying to get it synched after 5 calls to customer support where we reset the password and it didn't work.  I can't even review my bill to understand why I'm paying $170 per month to have a cell phone line and home internet,  NO TV!!

Nothing more to say, but complete and utter dysfunction.  I hope the executives are enjoying their experience at Cowboys stadium since they are paying Jerry Jones $19 million per year of company money for the naming rights.

Is your internet slow when you have UVERSE TV on? Mine too. 

AT&T seems to have established levels that you have to fight through as a customer. It's starts in the US, transfers to the real Battle Roya in India where the Customer Service rep defends their terms, then to the customer service rep's manager and then back to America when you're ready to cancel they give you pretty much what you were asking for originally.

It's annoying and a terrible experience. When did it become acceptable to nickel and dime your customers? Thanks cell phone companies.

If your UVERSE internet seems slow it's because when your TV is on the internet slows down. I split service providers. Works well now.

Instead of upsetting the Customer Rep in India - just do their little dance get to the manager and then tell them you want cancel your service and get to the cancellation process and see if they can resolve your issue.

Next...Did you know that if you move across state lines you have to start new service first calling one number, then call another number to cancel the old service. Well... I didn't. Apparently I had two accounts for quite some time. So one day, I found out I was being billed for the old service address and new service address as well. I call a few times to rationally speak to someone about removing these changes, but they could never find my account. So instead of fighting it, I requested a statement be delivered to me to pay it off. After waiting for weeks, I never received it. I called back to see about a faxed or emailed statement instead. These guys tell me they are unable to email or fax things. I'm sure this was the case in 1994, but in 2011? Doubtful.

I am with you guys for 6 years , i DO NOT  have late payments and  I have been told that you do NOT keep record for loyal people. on Tuesday I will probably spend my free time on the phone answering the questions of your STUPID phone service system AGAIN to fix the bill before I pay it.( by the way you have to have an option  to pres a key for ""yes"" or ""no"" so your  stupid  phone system  will  understand ) Now you know why I  am NOT going to  set up automaptic  payment and now you know why I am getting ready  to cancel my internet account and my phone service with you. On another hand  we both know that you really DO NOT CARE and I DO have feeling that no one  in this corporate read the reviews ",Negative,100.0000,1,Google

maybe 10 times a day. To get the problem fixed means spending at least an hour on the phone, navigating
an automated answering system to reach someone who may or may not get permission (from his computer!?) to do something.

Hopefully, their system is up (this was the third time in 6 mo.s I called when their computer system was undergoing 'routine' maintenance).

In the last couple of years, the number of levels on this answering tree has doubled or tripled. The technicians are less and less capable of responding to requests, and my bill has increased from ~$20 to ~$50 /mo. ($600 /year). I finally had to call a repair technician (my Harry Tuttle) on his personal line to get an appointment scheduled.

Definitely not the worst service (that award goes to Time Warner, and formerly Comcast), but bad enough 
that I'm looking for another provider so I can change again. ",Negative,99.9999,2,Google

Not surprisingly this store is usually surrounded by guards and is in a state they refer to as ""LOCKDOWN"" and only ATT employees with picture ID are allowed to enter (I assume it's to keep the angry mobs who have ATT service from entering to make their complaints).

The premium package. And it wasn't because of cost. I liked and was very pleased with the entire installation process but last night was my very first experience with the customer service people through the 800# and what a horrible experience.  It almost makes me wonder why I switched services.  GOOD customer service is key to whom I choose to do business with and the first real problem I have the experience was WAY below expected!!!  I am going to send a letter to their corporate office about this and wonder if I'll get a response. ,Negative,92.9074,1,Google

The customer service is at least 10x better than it was at Time Warner and the price is lower. Can't wait to get my next iPhone! ,Positive,99.9692,1,Google

I have 5 utility bills and I can pay the other 4 in about a quarter of the time it takes me to deal with AT&T's awful service.  Not to mention, they recommended I link my AT&T acct with yahoo to ...
